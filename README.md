# Memory Card Game for The Odin Project - Overwatch Edition

[Live Demo](https://paposeco.github.io/memorycardgame/)

This is a simple memory card game with Overwatch Heroes. The purpose of this exercise was to practice React. It was a very quick project. Suspiciously quick to be honest.

## Features

The user will try to click only once on each heroe portrait. Every time the user clicks on a portrait the user gets +1 point, if the portrait hadn't been clicked before. If the portrait had been clicked before, the score resets to 0. Every time the game resets, depending on the obtained score, Best Score is updated.
